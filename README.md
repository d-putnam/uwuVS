uwuVS is an in-browser video instrument inspired by analog video synthesis, built in React utilizing [Three.JS](https://threejs.org/) for GLSL rendering.

The user has access to sixteen parameters to manipulate the image and apply post-processing. This can be done using the HTML slider interface, or by sending MIDI messages from other software. Please see the about page for full MIDI implementation.
